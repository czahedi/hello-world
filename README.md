# hello-world
Repo for Git tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

I'm Cameron. I'm re-learning git since I messed with it via CLI but not the UI.

And now in 2019 I'm working through the tutorial again for practice.

Quite frankly the UI is pretty straightforward, I think I need to learn more about programming and making a local environment than going through this, but meh.
